# SRT-to-Textgrid
Converts .SRT subtitle files into .Textgrid files on Python
Notably, this converter is able to bulk convert entire input folders and drop cleaned SRTs and TextGrids into an output folder
Make sure your input folder only contains SRT files which you want to convert. If your transcription export service has an option, split your subtitles by sentence and do not include speaker information.
